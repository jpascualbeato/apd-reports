ICANN has published the Alternate Path to Delegation Reports and lists of Second-Level Domains (SLDs) to block for all eligible proposed new gTLDs. Nearly all of the applied for new gTLD strings have been found eligible to proceed with the Alternate Path to Delegation prior to receiving their Name Collision Occurrence Assessments.

This repository contains the CSV files published by ICANN at http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/announcements-and-media/announcement-2-17nov13-en.
